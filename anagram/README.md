# Anagram

Problem Statement:

Sid is obsessed with reading short stories. Being a CS student, he is doing some interesting frequency analysis with the books. He chooses strings S1 and S2 in such a way that |len(S1)−len(S2)|≤1.

Your task is to help him find the minimum number of characters of the first string he needs to change to enable him to make it an anagram of the second string.

Note: A word x is an anagram of another word y if we can produce y by rearranging the letters of x.
