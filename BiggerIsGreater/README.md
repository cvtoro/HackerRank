# HackerRank Bigger is Greater
Given a word w, rearrange the letters of w to construct another word s in such a way that s is lexicographically greater than w.
In case of multiple possible answers, fint the lexicographically smallest one among them.

For each testcase, output a string lexicographically bigger than w in a separate line.
In case of multiple possible answers, print the lexicographically smallest one, and if no answer exists, print no answer.



Example input:
```
5
ab
bb
hefg
dhck
dkhc
```

Example output:
```
ba
no answer
hegf
dhkc
hcdk
```


Current solution only works for small number of testcases.
